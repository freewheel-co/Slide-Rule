![alt tag](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14391908/full.png)


Slide Rule is built using [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/), a very handy presentation framework, to provide a way to view multiple widths of the same page at the same time.

Here is an example: [freewheel.io/slide-rule](http://freewheel.io/slide-rule/)

Here is a [codepen](http://codepen.io/_jonm/pen/bkfli)

### Use the arrow keys to navigate between the different widths.
### Set the site url with the "site" variable towards the bottom of index.html.

*Works great with LiveReload.
