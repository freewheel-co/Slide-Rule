# Slide Rule
## A tool for responsive web development

Slide Rule was built using [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/), a very handy presentation framework, to provide a way to view multiple widths of the same page at the same time.

### Use the arrow keys to navigate between the different widths.
### Set the site url with the "site" variable towards the bottom of index.html.

*Works great with LiveReload.
