# Slide Rule
## A tool for responsive web development

Slide Rule was built using impress.js, a very handy presentation library, to provide a dynamic way of viewing webpages at different widths on the same page.

### Use the arrow keys to navigate between the different widths.
### Set the site url with the "site" variable towards the bottom of index.html.
